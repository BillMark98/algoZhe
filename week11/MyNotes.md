## vector.resize()
if vector already has elements,
`_phoneMania.resize(1,vec[i])` will keep the original `_phoneMania[0]` value, instead of changing it to the vec[i]

## hashTable
* using while loop, need to be careful the index which needed to be incremented will be incremented to prevent endless loop.

* be careful about whether to use `index` or `probeIndex`
